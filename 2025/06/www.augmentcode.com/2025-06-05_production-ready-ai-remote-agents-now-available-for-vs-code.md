Today, we're excited to announce the general availability of [Augment Code’s Remote Agents.](https://docs.augmentcode.com/using-augment/remote-agent)

Remote Agents enable engineers to run multiple development tasks concurrently in the cloud, expanding your ability to explore, prototype, and iterate beyond the constraints of linear time. To start building with Remote Agents, sign up for Augment Code today.  If you're already using Augment, make sure you are on VS Code extension version v0.472.1 or higher.

### **The time paradox in engineering**

Great engineers are constantly wrestling with a simple truth: you can't do everything you want to do. Strategic initiatives get delayed. Promising experiments sit on the shelf. Innovation waits while maintenance takes center stage. Imagine having a team of AI-powered assistants who can explore multiple directions simultaneously, while you focus on the most critical decisions.

Remote Agents don't just complete tasks—they expand your team's capacity to ship.

**Use Remote Agents to:**

* Tackle technical debt: Fix small bugs and papercuts that never make it to your priority list
* Refactor with confidence: Restructure code while maintaining conventions and ensuring bug-free operation
* Boost test coverage: Automatically generate comprehensive unit tests for new and existing features
* Explore multiple solutions: Run parallel agents to prototype alternative implementations
* Accelerate documentation: Generate detailed documentation for libraries and features

### **What people are saying:**

*“I don’t think the next big leap in software productivity comes from ‘vibe coding.’ It comes from removing the grind in real codebases. Augment Code’s new Remote Agent tackles flaky tests, stale docs & tedious refactors—with up to 10 autonomous agents.”* [Eric Schmidt, Former Executive Chairman & CEO, Google](https://x.com/ericschmidt/status/1920246354229563888)

*“The Remote Agent is great for clearly scoped tasks with a clearly defined outcome. Learning to break development up into clearly scoped tasks with clearly defined outcomes is going to become a highly leveraged software development skill. My first success was telling the genie to copy the tests & implementation strategy from Python & implement the equivalent code in idiomatic Rust. Not many iterations later I had my PR."* [Kent Beck, Inventor of Extreme Programming](https://kentbeck.com/)

*“After spending the time using Remote Agents, I already can tell that this is the future. Remote Agents force you as the developer to level up your thinking. Now if you can think of clear and parallel features to develop you can dramatically increase your throughput.”* [Chris Dunlop, CEO & Co-Founder of Cub Digital](https://medium.com/realworld-ai-use-cases/augment-code-remote-agent-code-without-turning-on-your-computer-9cbf2864babe)

### **What makes Augment’s Remote Agents different?**

We were the [first to announce Remote Agent functionality](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/introducing-remote-agent) on May 7. Since then, we’ve seen similar features emerge from our competitors–but not all AI coding tools are created equal.

Here’s what’s different about Remote Agent:

1. **Purpose-Built Cloud Workers** Augment spins up independent, containerized agents that continue coding after you log off, delivering ready-to-merge PRs. Unlike tools trapped in single environments, our agents work autonomously across your entire infrastructure.
2. **Intelligent Context Management** Our [semantic index](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/a-real-time-index-for-your-codebase-secure-personal-scalable) retrieves relevant code snippets in milliseconds, ensuring agents maintain context across complex, multi-repo projects. No more losing the thread or relying on brute-force context windows.
3. **Enterprise-Grade Privacy** With a non-extractable architecture and [strict no-training guarantee](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/4-essential-data-questions-for-your-ai-coding-platform), Augment eliminates the data uncertainties that slow AI adoption in serious engineering teams.
4. **True Workflow Control** Granular agent management lets you launch, monitor, and terminate tasks in real-time.
5. **Seamless Integration** Launch agents directly from your preferred IDE without disrupting your existing workflow. [Augment adapts to you, not the other way around.](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/to-fork-or-not-to-fork)

### **Software development has always been about context, not coding**

Software development is transforming, and AI is the catalyst. This isn't about replacing developers, but fundamentally changing how we work. Today's engineers are becoming orchestrators of intelligent systems, not just coders.

The most valuable skill is no longer writing every line of code, but curating, guiding, and reviewing AI-generated work. LLMs can handle the repetitive, tedious tasks that used to consume our time. They don't replace our judgment—they amplify it. The median developer will now focus on what truly matters: strategic problem-solving, system design, and making critical decisions.

This isn't a threat; it's an opportunity. We're raising the floor of software development, making complex tasks more accessible while freeing talented engineers to tackle more challenging problems.
