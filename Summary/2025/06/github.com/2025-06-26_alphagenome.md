## 要約

Google DeepMindのAlphaGenome APIは、DNA配列から**遺伝子発現**、**スプライシング**、**クロマチン**、**コンタクトマップ**など多様な機能的予測を可能にする統合モデルを提供する。最大100万塩基の入力を1塩基精度で解析し、変異効果予測で最先端性能を実現。非商用なら無償で利用でき、Colabノートブックを通じて迅速に開始できる。リポジトリにはクライアントコードとチュートリアル、可視化ライブラリを備え、小規模〜中規模解析に適している。APIキー取得後の使用方法や視覚化手順、フォーラムによるサポート情報も詳細に提供される。研究利用時の引用方法もREADMEで案内されている。

The AlphaGenome API provides access to AlphaGenome, Google DeepMind’s unifying
model for deciphering the regulatory code within DNA sequences. This repository
contains client-side code, examples and documentation to help you use the
AlphaGenome API.

AlphaGenome offers multimodal predictions, encompassing diverse functional
outputs such as gene expression, splicing patterns, chromatin features, and
contact maps (see [diagram below](#model_overview)). The model analyzes DNA
sequences of up to 1 million base pairs in length and can deliver predictions at
single base-pair resolution for most outputs. AlphaGenome achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a range of genomic prediction benchmarks,
including numerous diverse variant effect prediction tasks (detailed in
[Avsec et al. 2025](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/papers/alphagenome.pdf)).

The API is offered free of charge for
[non-commercial use](https://deepmind.google.com/science/alphagenome/terms)
(subject to the terms of use). Query rates vary based on demand – it is well
suited for smaller to medium-scale analyses such as analysing a limited number
of genomic regions or variants requiring 1000s of predictions, but is likely not
suitable for large scale analyses requiring more than 1 million predictions.
Once you obtain your API key, you can easily get started by following our
[Quick Start Guide](#quick-start).

</a>

The documentation also covers a set of comprehensive tutorials, variant scoring
strategies to efficiently score variant effects, and a visualization library to
generate `matplotlib` figures for the different output modalities.

We cover additional details of the capabilities and limitations in our
documentation. For support and feedback:

-   Please submit bugs and any code-related issues on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphagenome/issues).
-   For general feedback, questions about usage, and/or feature requests, please
    use the [community forum](https://www.alphagenomecommunity.com) – it’s
    actively monitored by our team so you're likely to find answers and insights
    faster.
-   If you can't find what you're looking for, please get in touch with the
    AlphaGenome team on alphagenome@google.com and we will be happy to assist
    you with questions. We’re working hard to answer all inquiries but there may
    be a short delay in our response due to the high volume we are receiving.

## Quick start

The quickest way to get started is to run our example notebooks in
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Here are some some starter
notebooks:

-   [Quick start](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/alphagenome/blob/main/colabs/quick_start.ipynb):
    An introduction to quickly get you started with using the model and making
    predictions.
-   [Visualizing predictions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/alphagenome/blob/main/colabs/visualization_modality_tour.ipynb):
    Learn how to visualize different model predictions using the visualization
    libraries.

Alternatively, you can dive straight in by following the
[installation guide](#installation) and start writing code! Here's an example of
making a variant prediction:

```python
from alphagenome.data import genome
from alphagenome.models import dna_client
from alphagenome.visualization import plot_components
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


API_KEY = 'MyAPIKey'
model = dna_client.create(API_KEY)

interval = genome.Interval(chromosome='chr22', start=35677410, end=36725986)
variant = genome.Variant(
    chromosome='chr22',
    position=36201698,
    reference_bases='A',
    alternate_bases='C',
)

outputs = model.predict_variant(
    interval=interval,
    variant=variant,
    ontology_terms=['UBERON:0001157'],
    requested_outputs=[dna_client.OutputType.RNA_SEQ],
)

plot_components.plot(
    [
        plot_components.OverlaidTracks(
            tdata={
                'REF': outputs.reference.rna_seq,
                'ALT': outputs.alternate.rna_seq,
            },
            colors={'REF': 'dimgrey', 'ALT': 'red'},
        ),
    ],
    interval=outputs.reference.rna_seq.interval.resize(2**15),
    # Annotate the location of the variant as a vertical line.
    annotations=[plot_components.VariantAnnotation([variant], alpha=0.8)],
)
plt.show()
```

## Installation

<!-- mdformat off(disable for [!TIP] format) -->

> [!TIP]
> You may optionally wish to create a
> [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to
> prevent conflicts with your system's Python environment.

<!-- mdformat on -->

To install `alphagenome`, clone a local copy of the repository and run `pip
