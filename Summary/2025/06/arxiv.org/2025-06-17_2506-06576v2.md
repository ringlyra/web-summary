## 要約

本論文では、**AIエージェント**が労働市場へ及ぼす影響を定量化するため、新しい監査枠組みを提案する。米国104職種に対して1,500人への音声インタビューを実施し、望ましい人間の関与度を数値化する**HAS**指標を設定。AI専門家による技術評価と突き合わせ、844タスクを「グリーンライト」など四ゾーンに分類した**WORKBank**データベースを作成した。その結果、職種ごとに期待と現実が大きく異なり、AI導入後は情報処理能力より対人能力が重要になる可能性が示唆された。開発者は人の望む介在度を尊重し、AIエージェントの実装を進めるべきだと強調する。研究は政策や教育現場でも希望に基づく設計が重要だと指摘し、さらに人材育成の方向性にも示唆を与える。

| Editor with 3-5 Years of Experience: |
| I proofread and copy-edit marketing materials, mostly in the travel and tourism sector. I also do some copywriting and script writing for different ad clients and some light design work. |
| I look through flyers, brochures, other marketing materials, and I do several passes for mistakes in grammar, in consistency, in flow and clarity. And I make changes on the document, usually a PDF, and send them back to the client. They fix them, they send me another version, and I do several more passes until we’ve spent enough time and got it perfect. I mainly use Adobe products, PDFs in Adobe Reader. I also use Microsoft Word and some Adobe Suite products, mostly Illustrator and InDesign. |
| For copy editing, I read through whatever material the client has sent me. I do a pass for basic grammar. I do a pass for clarity and flow, often changing the copy significantly to make it sound better. For proofreading, I go through the materials. Same thing, but with less of a view toward changing the copy and more toward finding errors in grammar and consistency and even design. For copywriting, I make an outline of my ideas for the project and complete a rough draft. Then I spend some time away from it and revise until I have a polished draft for the client. |
| I’m resistant to using AI in my daily workflow. If I’m forced to use it, I would use it for basic grammar editing, but I would check each suggestion against my own knowledge very carefully and give it full consideration before adopting it as a change. |
| Editor With More Than 10 Years of Experience: |
| So I work in a media company, [masked], and as an editor I make sure that all JavaScript that I’m going to print are formatted correctly, the colors are accurate, and there are no typos. |
| So a lot of what I do involves sitting at a computer using productivity tools like Adobe Creative Suite, Canva, QuarkXPress, and using the Google Enterprise. So for email, document sharing, I use Google Docs quite a bit for my editing purposes, but I’ll also receive files in PDF format. So just working with all the different tools on my computer to get my tasks done every day.

| So one of the most frequent pieces of software I use is Adobe Acrobat, and that is really great for editing PDFs. The next most frequent software I use would be Google Docs. Receiving files through Google Docs, that’s a great way to be able to provide updates and edits to annotate the files. And then I would say other tools like Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, QuarkXPress, Microsoft Publisher. Those are occasionally used, but that’s really about all four of the frequently used programs, I would say.

| So, when I’m reviewing PDF documents, I will use the markup tool to add comments and highlight certain sections to make sure that the wording is accurate, or if there’s questions regarding the resolution of a photo, I can send that back to mark that up and say, hey, this needs to be a higher resolution photo, it won’t print out correctly. So it’s just a lot of manual review of every single file before it goes to print to make sure that everything is properly formatted, the colors are accurate, and it will reproduce correctly, just to make sure everything looks good for the customer.

| So, I’m using AI right now when it comes to email, so with the Google suite, there are Google Gemini tools that help with formatting emails. I can take a very simple format for content for email and then using that to expand those topics and make it more of a wordy email. But I would like to be able to use AI more in my proofreading and editing than I am right now, so probably within the next couple months I should be able to do that. |
| Mathematician With 3-5 Years of Experience: |
| I do number theory and algebraic geometry, mostly around long-length programs or categorical long-length programs. [In my daily work, I] read papers and write papers. |
| Solving a math problem, I don’t know [whether there is any specific tool to use], just read papers and have an intuition of what the procedure of philosophy should be and work on it. |
| To be honest, I think [AI is] useless at this moment. |
| Mathematician With 3-5 Years of Experience: |
| I am studying geometric representation theory and categorical Langlands program. My work involves coming up the problem to work on and learning math tools to help me think of solutions. |
| I need to spend a lot of time reading papers and learning math tools. I also need to attend the seminar to find collaborators. Then I work on my problem. [In terms of tools,] I mainly use latex. I spend most of my time studying math. Papers in my field can have hundreds of pages - it takes a long time to understand and try to apply the technique. |
| At present, I don’t think AI has any use for mathematicians, at least for DeepSeek and ChatGPT. One core question I am interested in is whether AI can come up with new stuffs that haven’t been proposed before rather than solving problems people craft. |
| Mathematician With 6-10 Years of Experience: |
| I used to study number theory, in particular, p-adic Hodge theory in arithmetic geometry. Now, I work on the formalization of p-adic Hodge theory in Lean and also auto-formalization and auto theorem proving. |
| During formalization, I elaborate, generalize, and fill gaps in mathematical proofs. I design general fomalization frameworks and spend lots of time in Lean coding. Lean coding involves searching theorems, formalizing statements and filling in formalization details in the proof. The last part is the longest part. For auto formalization and formal theorem proving, I spend most of the time coding to establish the LLM’s training pipeline and preparing data for the training. I use the interactive theorem prover Lean. I also use LeanSearch and other tools related to Lean to accelerate. I use Python for LLM training and use DeepSeek for coding and debugging. |
| [Here is a concrete example of my workflow:] I formalized a famous number theory definition, called the period rings of Fontaine. I first wrote down a detailed version of the mathematical statements and proofs I need. Splitting the whole formalization project into several smaller goals. For each smaller goal, I generalize and design suitable definitions and lemmas for formalization. Then I begin actual formalization using Lean. I first write down the definitions and state the theorems in Lean without proof. After this, I fill in the proofs backwards, searching the library for existing theorems to use and design patterns to mimic. During formalization, I revise the natural language proof from time to time. |
| I think a primary AI tool could help me in filling in searching for theorems and design patterns during formalization. A stronger AI tool would do auto-formalization of theorem statements and provide suggestions in designs. An even stronger AI tool would be able to elaborate and fill gaps in mathematical proofs and autoformalize the human proofs. Additionally, an AI tool strong in coding, debugging, and software engineering would help a lot in coding. |
| Aerospace Engineer With 3-5 Years of Experience: |
| I am an aeronautic engineer. I work in the aircraft maintenance, repairs, design aircraft. I work with [masked]. |
| We design aircraft, develop, test, and maintain aircrafts, and the systems that operate within Earth’s atmosphere, such as airplane, helicopters, drones, and missiles, though we’re not into missiles, though. Our work focuses on making aircraft, machines, very safe and efficient, capable of flight. We use Computer-Aided Design as a tool for Autodex, AutoCAD, Cartier, and Solidwork. And we use Computer Fluid Dynamics. It’s ANSYS Fluent, STAR-CNC-MM. What else? We use Finite Element Analysis. It’s a tool we use for Nastran. |
| [In my opinion,] AI is going to be very awesome and it’s going to make it very easier for us because most of the time, the main problem we have is detecting where the problem is in the engine, you know, so you have to do a lot of manual jobs and all that. So, but if we have AI, you can possibly tell in the dash cam or whatever, you know, you can possibly tell. |
| Aerospace Engineer With 1-2 Years of Experience: |
| I’m a current undergraduate senior and prospective master’s student in aerospace engineering, working in guidance, navigation, and controls, so like more simulation, computer programming side of aerospace engineering. |
| Most of what I do for work has traditionally been programming simulations to evaluate vehicle performance for orbital rockets. And so most of my tasks will be either building out a part of the simulation, programming new features or new testing, or kind of similar types of modeling of different subsystems of the rocket. |
| In general the tools or software that I use would be Visual Studio Code for the actual programming. The companies I’ve worked at have used project management tools like JIRA and Confluence. I think also just a lot of internet documentation is useful. And yeah, I very occasionally would use an AI tool like ChatGPT. Generally, my process would be to understand the requirements, which would involve talking to my manager, then kind of going about kind of like pre-reading or other types of information gathering necessary for the task, actual programming, and then like unit testing and other ways of forms of validation for the programming that I completed. |
| Honestly, I don’t use AI too much in my current workflow. I think that the only time that it could come up would be if I’m running into some type of error or bug in my program that I can’t find, or kind of a quick piece of code that I could look up how to do, but it’s easier to just ask a AI model to generate. But honestly, I use it very, very infrequently. |
