Rujikorn Charakorn1Edoardo Cetin1Yujin Tang1Robert T. Lange1 Abstract While Foundation Models provide a general toolfor rapid content creation, they regularly requiretask-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the underlying model. Finetuning techniques enable practitioners to adaptfoundation models for many new applications butrequire expensive and lengthy training while being notably sensitive to hyperparameter choices.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adaptinglarge language models (LLMs) on the fly solelybased on a natural language description of thetarget task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a single inexpensive forward pass.
After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show thatthe ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA instances matchthe performance of task-specific adapters acrossthe corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2Lcan compress hundreds of LoRA instances andzero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. Thisapproach provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of foundation models and enables language-based adaptation withminimal compute requirements.

1. Introduction Biological systems are capable of rapid adaptation, givenlimited sensory cues. For example, the human visual systemcan tune its light sensitivity and focus through neuromodulation of the fovea and rod cells (Wurtz et al., 2011; Digre & Brennan, 2012). While recent LLMs exhibit a wide variety of capabilities and knowledge, they remain rigid when 1Sakana AI. Correspondence to: Rujikorn Charakorn <rujikorn@sakana.ai >, Robert T.

In such cases, practitionersoften resort to re-training parts of the model (Gururanganet al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021; Dettmers et al., 2022; Tay et al., 2021) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA, Hu et al., 2022). Typically, a LoRA adapter has to be optimized for each downstreamtask and requires task-specific dataset and hyperparametersetting. This fine-tuning scheme for adaptation significantlylimits the possibility of transferring knowledge betweentasks and induces engineering overhead. Recently, it hasbeen observed that by inducing structural constraints, thelow-rank matrices learned by LoRA adapters can be further compressed. For example, one can train lossy versionsof the original adapter while maintaining downstream performance (Br ¨uel-Gabrielsson et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Kopiczko et al., 2024). Furthermore, multiple LoRAs can becombined for new tasks at inference time (Ostapenko et al., 2024). At the core of these approaches lies the explicit useof decomposition or dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., SVD or routing) for better compression and onlinecomposition of existing LoRAs. This raises the followingquestions:
1.Can we end-to-end train a neural network tocompress many pre-trained LoRAs?
2.Can we decode new task-specific LoRAadapters solely based on natural-language instructions for an unseen task at test time?
We hypothesize that different LoRA adapters share the sameunderlying adaptation mechanism and can be optimized simultaneously without any explicit structure or recipe forcombining them. To explicitly test this hypothesis, we proposeT2L, a hypernetwork (Ha et al., 2016) that compressestask-specific LoRAs and generates new LoRA adapters zeroshot at inference time. T2L is trained to compress LoRAson a diverse task distribution from the Super Natural Instructions (SNI) dataset (Wang et al., 2022). Importantly, T2Ltakes a natural language description of the target task as aninput, allowing zero-shot LoRA generation to unseen tasks.
Empirically, we show that T2L can effectively be trainedeither to reconstruct pre-trained adapters or via supervisedfine-tuning on a distribution of downstream tasks (see Fig-Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption Task emb Hypernetwor k 𝚫𝐖 Target𝚫𝐖 Reconstruction loss𝐖𝟎 𝐖′+ 𝒙 𝓛(ෝ𝒚,𝒚) SFT loss Base modelT2L Training The hypernet is trained either via reconstruction or SFT loss 1248163264128256512 Compression ratio0.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0Rel. performance to oracles T2L (L) T2L (M) T2L (S) Avg.

ure 1, top right). After training, T2L outperforms a multitask LoRA baseline and Arrow Routing (Ostapenko et al., 2024), a state-of-the-art zero-shot LoRA routing method, on various benchmark tasks. Furthermore, we show that T2L can generate LoRA adapters for previously unseentasks solely using the language-based task description. Thisresult highlights the generalization capabilities and applicability of our proposed indirect adaptation encoding. Ourcontributions are summarized as follows:
1.We introduce hypernetwork-based architectures forproducing LoRA adapters with a single forward pass (Section 3) based on text descriptions. T2L architectures can be trained using both distillation of pretrained adapters and supervised multi-task fine-tuning.
2.We show that T2L can efficiently encode hundredsof LoRA adapters (Section 4). While the compression is lossy, T2L maintains the performance of taskspecifically tuned LoRA adapters. Furthermore, T2Lcan generalize to unseen tasks given suitable naturallanguage descriptions of the tasks.
3.We provide rigorous ablations (Section 5) including T2L scaling with datasets (see Figure 1, bottom right),the impact of different task description embeddings, the training routines, and text-based task descriptions.
4.Finally, we analyze the nature of T2L generations. Wefind semantically meaningful LoRA clusters when visualizing the generated LoRAs in a dimensionalityreduced space (Section 5.5). Furthermore, we studythe relationship between LoRA adapters and find compelling evidence why reconstruction-trained T2L cannot generalize (Appendix D).
2. Preliminaries We utilize multiple fine-tuning datasets D={D1, . . . ,DT}, which correspond to different tasks T={t1, . . . , tT}. Forthe purpose of training T2L, we assume that each finetuning dataset has a set of natural language task descriptions (Zi={zi 1, . . . , zim}):Di={Xi, Yi, Zi}. The task descriptions do not need to be specific to each sample butrather a general description of the dataset. For a single taskti, the fine-tuning objective of an LLM with pre-trainedweights ( Ψ) is given by ∆Wi= argmin ∆WiLSFT(Di,Ψ,∆Wi), (1) Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption Task emb Taskencoder Module emb Depth embMLP MLP MLP MLP + HeadA/BembRankembM S S + Both A and B [2, r, d]A or B [r, d]M One rank ofA or B [d]L S Figure 2: Overview of T2L architectural variations.

For the multi-task setting, we train a single adapter ∆Wtominimize the expected loss over the union of all datasets D:
∆W= argmin ∆WEDi∼DLSFT(Di,Ψ,∆W). (2) Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA, Hu et al., 2022): LoRA isa parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that freezes the pretrained weights of a base model and only learns low-rankweight matrices, which serve as an adapter to the base model.
For each selected linear transformation h=W0x, the finetuned transformation is given by h=W0x+ ∆Wx= W0x+BTAx, where A, B∈Rr×dare weight matricesof rank r < d . We omit the layer index and module typeof the LoRA weights when referring to all LoRA weights.
Otherwise, we use subscripts to represent the layer indexand module type, e.g., ∆Wm,l, where mis the module type (e.g., query projection) and lis the layer index.
Hypernetworks: A hypernetwork is a neural network thatgenerates parameters for another ‘base’ network (Ha et al., 2016). It serves as an indirect encoding (Schmidhuber, 1997; Stanley & Miikkulainen, 2003; Zhang et al., 2018; Schuget al., 2024) of the base network, given that the parametercount of the hypernetwork is much smaller. This compression is achieved by learning to share parameters indirectly.
More specifically, given a layer-specific descriptor vectorϕl, a hypernetwork with parameters θgenerates the parameters of the base model at layer l∈ {1, . . . L}as follows:
Wl=hθ(ϕl). Traditionally, the layer descriptors are eitherone-hot or learned vectors. The weights θare then trainedvia end-to-end optimization on a downstream task.
3. Text-to-LoRA: Learning to Compress and Generate LoRAs In this work, we utilize a hypernetwork to generate LoRAadapters for task-specific adaptation. For each target module (m) and layer index ( l), a hypernetwork generates the twolow-rank matrices A, B based on a task description zi∈Ziof a task tias follows:
∆Wim,l=hθ(ϕim,l),with (3) ϕim,l=concat f(zi), E[m], E[l]] , (4) where fgives a vector representation of a text description, typically represented by a CLS token of a bidirectional transformer model or last token activation of an LLM. Eis a learnable embedding dictionary indexed byeither a module type mor a layer index l. For legibility, we introduce a shorthand notation for T2L’s output ∆Wi:=hθ(ϕi):=hθ({ϕim,l}). Then, a supervised finetuning training objective for T2L isθ= argminθEDi∼D,zi∼ZiLSFT(Di,Ψ, hθ(ϕi)),(5) Note that values of mandlcan be batched, which allows T2L to generate ∆Wfor all modules and layer indicesefficiently within a single forward pass.
3.1. Text-to-LoRA Architectures Most of a hypernetwork’s parameters come from the output layer, which scales linearly with the size of the target weights (V on Oswald et al., 2019). To explore thecomplexity-performance trade-off, we propose three variants ofT2L:L,M, and S. We impose different outputspaces on the hypernetwork that represent different inductive biases and parameter counts (see Figure 2). We notethat all variants use the same backbone architecture andonly differ in their output heads and learnable embeddings.
The Larchitecture is the largest variant. Its final linearlayer outputs low-rank AandBmatrices simultaneously, with the number of weight connections to the output head |θhead|=dout×2×r×d, where doutis the output size ofthe last MLP block. M architecture is the medium-sizedmodel with a shared output layer between the low-rank AandBmatrices. That is, the head outputs a low-rank Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaptionmatrix, either AorB, depending on the learnable embedding. The size of the output head is |θhead|=dout×r×d.
Finally, Sarchitecture is the most parameter-efficientmodel with the strongest inductive biases, where the hypernetwork outputs only one rank of a low-rank matrix at atime. This output space makes the size of the head muchsmaller: |θhead|=demb×d. For reference, a LoRA adapterhasr×d×2×L× |M|trainable parameters, where Lis the number of layers and |M|is the number of targetmodules. The default value of doutis512. We note thatevery architecture can generate all the low-rank matrices AandBin a single forward pass by batching all the inputembeddings. We provide more details of the architectures in Appendix F and the weight initialization method that leadsto stable training in Appendix G.
3.2. Training Text-to-LoRA via LoRA Reconstruction The most straightforward way to train T2L is to reconstruct pre-trained task-specific LoRAs. This setup allowsus to utilize publicly available libraries of LoRAs (Br ¨uelGabrielsson et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024). Alternatively, one can also use a two-stage procedure, in which a libraryof LoRAs is pre-trained in the first stage and then train T2Lto reconstruct them. For the sole purpose of compressing LoRAs, we can train T2L using one-hot or learnable vectors as task embeddings. However, these embeddings do notallow zero-shot LoRA generation for unseen tasks. To enable zero-shot LoRA generation, we additionally condition T2L with embeddings of natural language task descriptions, which allows T2L to generate LoRA adapters for varioustasks—including unseen ones—given corresponding taskdescriptions. Given a suitable library of LoRA adapters Ω, the reconstruction loss for T2L can be written as L(Ω, θ) =E∆Wi∼Ω|∆Wi−hθ(ϕi)|. (6) 3.3.Training Text-to-LoRA via Supervised Fine-Tuning Alternatively, T2L can be directly optimized on fine-tuningdatasets. Training T2L with SFT sidesteps the need for intermediate target LoRA adapters and allows for end-to-endtraining. This training scheme is preferred if existing trained LoRAs are not naturally clustered by their functionalitiesor downstream tasks. For instance, t1andt2could be tworelated tasks requiring a similar LLM capability, but ∆W1and∆W2could be in different minima. Thus, T2L trainedvia reconstruction training would have to compress numerically different ∆W1and∆W2, making it less likely togeneralize. In fact, we empirically find that a T2L trainedvia reconstruction fails to generalize to unseen tasks (Section 5.4). In contrast, an SFT-trained T2L can implicitlylearn to cluster tasks, which has been shown to improve zeroshot LoRA routing performance (Ostapenko et al., 2024).
The SFT loss for T2L is given by Equation (5).4. Experiments We investigate the effectiveness of the different T2L architectures and training schemes in terms of the compressionof adapters (Section 4.1) and zero-shot LoRA generationfor unseen tasks (Section 4.2). As baselines, we considertask-specific LoRAs, element-wise averaged LoRA, andmulti-task LoRA—a LoRA adapter trained on all trainingtasks. We also implement Hyperdecoders (Ivison & Peters, 2022)—a hypernetwork that generates LoRAs on aper-sequence basis—based on our proposed architectures.
To boost the performance of the base models without finetuning, we utilize few-shot in-context learning (ICL, Brownet al., 2020; Dong et al., 2024) and task description prepending, i.e., providing task description at the beginning of eachquery. Additionally, we include results of Arrow Routingzero-shot performance from Ostapenko et al. (2024). Notethat the performance can only be compared indirectly asit uses a different set of LoRA adapters and training tasks.
Furthermore, there are likely differences in the benchmarkevaluation prompts.
In most experiments, we use Mistral-7B-Instruct (Jiang et al., 2023) as the base LLM model except in Tables 7 and 8 where Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-2b-Instruct are used as the base models, respectively. We use gte-large-en-v1.5 (Li et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) for extracting the task embedding from a natural language task description. All LoRAadapters are of rank 8 and only target the query and thevalue projection modules in every attention block of thebase LLM (totaling 3.4M parameters). With this LoRAconfiguration, L,M, and Shave 55M,34M, and 5Mtrainable parameters respectively.
We utilize the SNI dataset (Wang et al., 2022) for training LoRA adapters. We use a subset of 500 tasks following Br ¨uel-Gabrielsson et al. (2024). We use 11 tasks forhold-out validation and removed 10 datasets due to datacontamination from the evaluation benchmark tasks, leaving 479 datasets for training. All samples are in English.
More details of the datasets can be found in Appendix J.
For evaluation, we choose 10 widely used benchmarks thatcollectively cover a variety of LLM capability assessments, e.g., reasoning, math, science, coding, and world knowledge. Specifically, we include the following benchmarks:
Arc-challenge (ArcC) and Arc-easy (ArcE) (Clark et al., 2018), BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), Hellaswag (HS) (Zellers et al., 2019), OpenBookQA (OQA) (Mihaylov et al., 2018), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), Winogrande (WG) (Keisuke et al., 2019), HumanEval (HE) (Chen et al., 2021), and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021).1Task 1The benchmark tasks share some similarities with the training tasks. Specifically, they are mostly multiple-choice questionanswering tasks. Also, there are similar and overlapping domains Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption Table 1: Benchmark performance of T2L trained via reconstruction loss on 9 benchmark tasks.

When weuse a language task embedding as a part of the input, weaverageT2L performance using three descriptions for eachbenchmark.
4.1. LoRA Compression In this experiment, we aim to investigate whether T2L canrecover the performance of trained LoRAs via reconstruction training. For quality control and consistent evaluation, we train a task-specific LoRA (oracle) on the training split of each benchmark task, collectively forming alibrary of LoRAs. Table 1 shows the benchmark performance ofT2L trained by distilling 9 benchmark-specific LoRAs using either one-hot or natural language task embeddings from gte-large-en-v1.5 . We note that thebenchmark tasks are indirectly seen during training by T2L, as it learns to distill benchmark-specific LoRAs. We cansee thatT2L fully recovers the performance of the oracleadapters with both task embedding types. Notably, T2Loutperforms task-specific LoRAs on several benchmarks (highlighted in green). We hypothesize that the gain comesfrom the lossy compression of the target LoRAs, which actsas a regularization on the already trained LoRA weights.
This effect is most apparent on PIQA and WG benchmarks, where the oracle LoRA overfits and performs worse thanthe base model.
Next, we explore whether T2L conditioned on one-hot taskvectors can maintain the oracle single-task LoRAs’ performance when using an increasing number of training tasks.
Figure 3 shows the performance of one-hot T2L on thetest splits of a subset of 10 SNI training tasks with varyingbetween the two splits. For example, the ARC benchmarks aresimilar to SNI task #47. However, some benchmarks are very different from the training distribution, e.g., MBPP and HumanEval, as the training tasks do not contain any code generation tasks.

We train various T2L instances for each architecture using{16,32,64,128,256,479}training tasks, leading to aneffective increase in the training reconstruction error. AlthoughT2L fully recovers the oracles’ performance whenthe reconstruction loss is less than 10−4, the performancedrops as the training error increases. This result suggeststhatT2L learns a lossy compression of the target LoRAs.
Still, we find that all T2L architectures can maintain around 65% of oracles’ performance, and the performance doesnot drop further even at >8×10−4per-element L1 error. Despite the performance drop, we show that increasingthe number of training tasks is beneficial in the SFT setup, increasing zero-shot benchmark performance of T2L in Section 5.1.
4.2. Zero-Shot LoRA Generation Here, we explore whether T2L can generate useful LoRAadapters for unseen tasks. We train T2L with SFT on 479 SNI tasks, each with 128 task descriptions. For each datapoint in a training minibatch, we sample a description fromthe corresponding dataset in an online fashion. Table 2 Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption Table 2: Zero-shot performance on unseen benchmark tasks. SFT-trained T2L generates LoRAs based on unseen taskdescriptions. Its performance is an average of three generated LoRAs, each with a different instance of task descriptions.

Here, we present the best model of each variant from ourscaling experiment in Section 5.1. We observe that a multitask LoRA adapter performs well on the benchmarks despiteno additional fine-tuning. Still, there is a performance gapbetween task-specific LoRAs and MT LoRA. We observethat SFT-trained T2L indeed generates useful LoRAs, thusimproving over the multi-task LoRA adapter consistentlyand across benchmarks (indicated by bold numbers). Notably, even though T2L cannot fully bridge the performancegap with task-specific LoRAs, it outperforms the oracles ona subset of tasks (highlighted in green). We further investigate the generality of our proposed method with differentbase models including Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) and Gemma (Team et al., 2024) models in Appendix A. We notethat one of the main advantages of T2L is its efficiency. Toemphasize T2L’s efficiency, we provide an ad-hoc FLOPsanalysis in Appendix I.
5. Ablations and Analyses 5.1. Increasing Training Compute Proportional to the Number of Training Tasks In this section, we explore the scalability of T2L by varyingthe training tasks and scale the training budget proportionally to the dataset size on all variants. Table 3 shows that, after increasing the number of training tasks and computebudget,T2L generally benefits from the additional trainingtasks. However, Sdoes not benefit from extended trainingwith 479 tasks, potentially due to its limited model capacity.
We additionally investigate the effect of the task diversityon the robustness of T2L by training on more tasks withoutscaling the training budget in Appendix C. We find that it iscrucial to scale the compute budget according to the numberof training tasks. For instance, Mwith scaled computebudget improves over training runs with a fixed budget whenusing 256 or more training tasks.
5.2. Task Embedding Models Table 4 shows the zero-shot benchmark performance withtwo different embedding models: gte-large-en-v1.5andMistral-7B-Instruct . For thegte model, weextract a task description by using the activation of the CLStoken in the last layer as the model is a bidirectional model.
ForMistral , we use the activation of the last token in thesequence to represent a given description (BehnamGhaderet al., 2024). Table 4 shows the results with the two embedding models used for T2L SFT training on 128 tasks. Bothembedding models yield T2L instances with comparablegeneralization capability, suggesting T2L’s robustness totask description embedding methods.
5.3. Varying Task Descriptions We investigate the impact of task descriptions on the performance of generated LoRAs using four types of descriptions:
•Train: Training descriptions of corresponding tasks.
•Eval: Unseen descriptions of corresponding tasks.
•Random strings: Random literal strings.
•Train (random): Training descriptions randomly sampled from other tasks.

Note that we use reconstruction-trained T2L inthis experiment. That is, the hypernetwork has seen trainingdescriptions of the benchmarks during training. We observea performance gap between the two description categories.
Specifically, training and evaluation descriptions generatethe best performing LoRAs, matching the performance oforacle LoRAs, despite the evaluation descriptions beingunseen. These results suggest that T2L is robust to changesin the task description as long as the descriptions arealigned with the task. On the other hand, if the descriptionsare not aligned with the task at hand, the generated LoRAswill not perform as well, as indicated by the performanceTable 6: Reconstruction vs SFT training scheme.

We believe that using an LLMfor adjusting the description alignment could effectivelysidestep this failure case of T2L. Additionally, we providea qualitative result demonstrating steerability and anunsuccessful example of T2L in Figure 4. Importantly, thelast two examples in Figure 4 (iii, iv) are both correct buthave different answer styles thanks to different descriptions.
We remark that Hyperdecoders (Ivison & Peters, 2022) cannot exhibit such steerability as it uses the probleminstance as the input to the hypernetwork.
5.4. Training Schemes In this section, we investigate the zero-shot performanceof SFT-trained and reconstruction-trained T2L. All modelinstances are trained with roughly equal wall-clock time of 10 hours (see Appendix H for details). From Table 6, we cansee a clear performance gap between reconstruction and SFTtraining schemes. Specifically, SFT produces T2L instancesthat perform significantly better than those trained via reconstruction ( 66.3vs61.83benchmark performance averagedover model architectures). We attribute the performancedifference to the library of LoRAs needed for reconstructiontraining. For reconstruction-trained T2L to generalize, thetarget LoRA adapters of similar tasks should be clusteredin some latent manifold. In contrast, SFT training does notneed pre-trained task-specific LoRA adapters, thus sidestepping this challenge via end-to-end learning. In Appendix D, we show that pre-trained adapters for similar tasks do notlive nearby in the weight space, supporting our claim of a Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption User Input T oulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
How many sheep do T oulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?
(i) Base model response Great question! Let's break it down step by step:
1. W e know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 * 4 = <<20* 4=80>>80 sheep.
3. T oulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so T oulouse has 80 * 2 = <<80*2=160>>160 sheep.
4. T o ﬁnd the total number of sheep in all three cities, we add the number of sheep in each city: 160 (T oulouse) + 80 ( Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = <<160+80+20=240>>240 sheep.
So, T oulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together have 240 sheep.
(ii) Generate LoRA using the following ( low-quality ) description:
“solve this task please” Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, so Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.
T oulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so T oulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.
T oulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have sheep together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 240 sheep.
(iii) Generate LoRA using the following description:
“This task challenges your problem-solving abilities through mathematical reasoning. Y ou must carefully read eachscenario and systematically work through the data to compute the ﬁnal outcome.” T oulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so T oulouse has 2 * Charleston = 2 * 4 = 8 times as many sheep as Seattle.
Seattle has 20 sheep, so T oulouse has 8 * 20 = 160 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
T oulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have sheep together = 160 (T oulouse) + 80 ( Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260 sheep.
(iv) Generate LoRA using the following description:
“Use your programming skill to think algorithmically, logically and systematically. Carefully read each scenario andsystematically work through the data to compute the ﬁnal outcome. Use your math skill to calculate correctly.” let me check the relationships between the number of sheep in each city:
1. T oulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
From point 2, we know that Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. From point 1, T oulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.
So, T oulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 sheep.

potential problem when reconstructing pre-trained LoRAs.
5.5. Visualization of T2L Activations Next, we aim to understand T2L further and see whetherit generates task-specific LoRA adapters for unseen taskswith unseen descriptions. We probe SFT T2L Mtrainedon 256 training tasks in the zero-shot evaluation setting.
The model is probed on all the benchmark tasks, each withthree unseen descriptions. Figure 5 shows the 2D t-SNEprojection of T2L’s task encoder activations and the outputs of the last MLP block. We can see clear clustering inboth projection plots based on the tasks (colors and shapes).
T2L generates different adapters for different tasks, confirming that T2L indeed performs task-specific adaptation ‘on the fly’. Moreover, similar tasks, e.g., MBPP and HumanEval, are clustered together in both plots, suggestingthat SFT-trained T2L produces similar adapters for semantically similar tasks.6. Related Work Hypernetworks for Adaptation : Hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2016) provide a general indirect encoding method for neuralnetwork weights. They have been applied to different architectures (e.g., in attention, Schug et al., 2024) and trainingparadigms (e.g., in continual learning, V on Oswald et al., 2019). Here, we focus on generating low-rank adapters using natural language instructions. Previous work (Mahabadiet al., 2021; He et al., 2022; Ortiz-Barajas et al., 2024) considers hypernetworks for LLM adaptation in a multi-taskcontext but only uses learned task identifiers instead of natural language for adaptation. Thus, these approaches do notenable task-wise zero-shot generalization.
Hypernetworks for Zero-Shot LLM Adaptation: Xiaoet al. (2023) explore the use of hypernetworks on a limitedset of English dialects; they only consider five dialects, oneof which is unseen. Furthermore, the hypernetwork relieson an expert-based transformation of the dialects, limitingthe possibility for generalization. Mu et al. (2024) propose Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption 0 25 5075 0255075100Encoded Task Emb (perplexity=4) mbpparc_easywinograndehumanevalboolqpiqaopenbookqaarc_challengehellaswaggsm8k 0 50 100 15060 02040mbpparc_easywinograndehumanevalboolqpiqaopenbookqaarc_challengehellaswaggsm8k T2L Activation (perplexity=4) 0 50 100 15060 02040mbpparc_easywinograndehumanevalboolqpiqaopenbookqaarc_challengehellaswaggsm8k T2L Activation (perplexity=4) Figure 5: 2D t-SNE projection of activations of T2L’s task encoder (left) and activations of the last MLP block (right) grouped by benchmark tasks (represented by colors). We probe T2L with unseen three task descriptions per benchmark. Wecan see activations clustering in both plots, indicating that T2L indeed learns to generate LoRAs tailored to specific tasks.
Gisting, a method that learns to compress an in-context taskdescription to prefix tokens, allowing the language modelto follow instructions with fewer tokens. However, Gistingis limited to prefix tokens—only influencing the attentionmatrices of the base model. Thus, prefix tokens are lessflexible compared to LoRAs that can modify different partsof LLMs, e.g., attention blocks. Hyperdecoders (Ivison & Peters, 2022) is a hypernetwork that generates adapters onthe fly based on the input sequence. While per-sequenceadaptation is desirable for benchmark evaluation—wherethe LLM should always output the correct answer—weargue that description-based adaptation gives more controlto users since they can steer the LLM in creative ways basedon user-generated descriptions (see Figure 4). Furthermore, the generated adapters cannot be efficiently fused into thebase model, leading to significant overhead for each query.
Closely related to our work are HyperTuning (Phang et al., 2023), HNET-LM (Deb et al., 2022), and HINT (Ivisonet al., 2023). Differing from prior work that heavily focuseson pre-trained encoder-decoder models, e.g., T5 (Raffelet al., 2020) or BART (Lewis, 2019), we use frontier instruction fine-tuned models as the base models, i.e., Mistral , Llama ,Gemma . Also, prior work typically relies on initializing a part of their hypernetworks from the base model (e.g., tying task encoder’s weights to the base model) toachieve good performance or stable training as opposed toours that are task-embedder agnostic and can freely changethe task embedding model (Section 5.2). Additionally, ourwork utilizes generated descriptions instead of the ones provided by the SNI dataset. In Appendix B, we show thatusing generated descriptions increase the performance of T2L considerably. Overall, our work improves upon priorwork in several ways, including achieving task-wise zeroshot generalization on various frontier instruction-tunedlanguage models, simpler and more general hypernetworkinput requirements, investigation of training regimes, andmore comprehensive experiments, ablations, and analyses.
Concurrent to our work, Lv et al. (2024) propose a similarapproach that utilizes a hypernetwork to generate LoRAadapters at inference time. However, their hypernetworkassumes that the context vector provided to the hypernetwork contains few-shot examples. In contrast, T2L onlyassumes a task description, which users can produce themselves within seconds.
7. Discussion and Limitations Discussion . We rely on generated descriptions from GPT-4o mini to ensure high-quality and consistent taskdescriptions. It is plausible that when T2L is deployed inreal-world scenarios, users might not input high-quality descriptions, which could cause performance degradation ofgenerated adapters. Our results have primarily focused on LLM adaptation. However, T2L can be directly applied toother LLMs or to adapt vision language models. Finally, thepotential for T2L trained on a smaller base model to transfer effectively to larger models within the same architectureclass remains an open area for exploration.
Limitations . We only consider LoRA as the output spaceof the hypernetwork. We believe there are more efficientways to modulate LLMs given a text description, e.g., directly modulating the activations of the base model. Also, we believe the compression achieved by T2L can be furtheroptimized using well-designed inductive biases. Finally, althoughT2L exhibits robustness and signs of scalability, it still does not reach the benchmark performance of taskspecific LoRAs in a zero-shot manner. Achieving such potent zero-shot adaption is still one of the biggest challengesforT2L.
Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption Acknowledgment We thank David Ha for suggesting “Text-to-LoRA” as thetitle of the paper. We thank anonymous reviewers for theirconstructive feedback, which we incorporate to improve thequality of the paper.
Impact Statement This paper introduces Text-to-LoRA ( T2L), a novel approach that significantly lowers the barrier to adapting largefoundation models for specific tasks. Traditionally, customizing models like LLMs requires resource-intensivefine-tuning on specific datasets for each new application, limiting accessibility and slowing down deployment. T2Lovercomes this by training a hypernetwork to generate taskspecific Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) instantly, using onlya natural language description of the target task as input.
This eliminates the need for per-task fine-tuning datasetsand lengthy optimization processes, enabling rapid, on-thefly adaptation with minimal computational overhead duringinference, thereby making powerful model customizationmore accessible.
The broader impact of T2L lies in its potential to democratize the specialization of powerful AI systems by enablingadaptation through intuitive text instructions. While T2Ldemonstrates effective compression and promising zero-shotgeneralization to unseen tasks similar to those encounteredduring training, potential pitfalls exist that warrant consideration. Its performance is notably sensitive to the qualityand clarity of the natural language task descriptions; poorlyphrased or misaligned instructions could lead to suboptimalor incorrect adaptations, potentially hindering reliabilityin real-world user scenarios. Furthermore, while T2L significantly advances instant adaptation, its generalizationcapability to task types fundamentally different from itstraining distribution (e.g., beyond the SNI-derived benchmarks) needs further investigation, and it may not yet fullymatch the performance ceiling of adapters meticulously finetuned on extensive, high-quality datasets for highly complexor specialized domains.

Tables 7 and 8show the benchmark performance of T2L Lcompared to various baselines using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-2B-Instruct as the base models, respectively. With Gemma base model, we utilize ICL for all approachesas it drastically improves the performance on the MBPP benchmark. We see that T2L consistently outperforms the baselinesacross all tested models with varying model sizes and architectures. We note that T2L are trained with the same set ofhyperparameters across base models.

As the SNI datasets are crowd-sourced, we hypothesized that the task descriptions might have inconsistent template orvaried levels of details. Thus, it is harder for T2L to learn and generalize.
C. Scaling the Number of Training Tasks with Fixed Compute We study the impact of the number of training tasks on the zero-shot benchmark performance of T2L in the SFT setting, where allT2L instances are trained for roughly the same number of gradient steps (see details in Appendix H). Overall, wefind that increasing the number of training tasks improves the average zero-shot benchmark performance of the hypernetwork (Figure 1 and Table 10). This result hints at the plausible scalability of T2L and positive transfer between tasks.

LoRAs of Similar Tasks Here, we investigate the relationship between LoRA adapters by inspecting their similarity in the parameter space, performance on the benchmarks, and similarity of their description embeddings. To measure adapter similarity, we computethe cosine similarity of the concatenation of flattened low-rank AandBmatrices of all layers. In the top row of Figure 6, we plot the adapters’ similarity against task description similarity (using the mean embedding of each task). We findno correlation between the cosine similarity of the adapters’ weights (y-axis) and the task embedding similarity (x-axis) indicated by near-zero Pearson correlation coefficients.
In the bottom row of Figure 6, we change the y-axis from adapters’ relative benchmark performance to benchmark-specificadapters. We find a positive correlation between the relative benchmark performance of SNI-trained adapters and the taskembedding similarity. That is, adapters perform better on a benchmark if their task descriptions are similar to those of thebenchmark. However, despite their similar functionalities, adapters with similar descriptions are not similar in the parameterspace. We believe that this relationship has a significant impact on the limited generalization of reconstruction-trained T2L.
We further discuss this topic in Appendix K.

Thus, we increase the epochs to 100,000to ensure that T2L converges.

Bottom row: Each plot shows SNI-trained adapters’ performance relative to a benchmark adapter (y-axis) with the same x-axis. We can see that LoRAswith similar description embeddings to the benchmarks’ perform better in those benchmarks, suggesting their sharedfunctionalities. However, LoRAs with similar functionalities are not nearby in the parameter space.
F. Additional Details of T2L Architectures Listings 2 and 3 show the details of the backbone of T2L. Specifically, the size of the module and layer embedding ( E[m] andE[l]) is 32D. Together, they form a dictionary of 34 learnable embeddings (32 layers + 2 target modules). The taskencoder is a linear layer that takes in a text embedding (1024D for the gte embedding and 4096D for Mistral embedding) and outputs a 64D vector. The encoded task, module, and layer embedding are concatenated and then fed into mlp0followed by a residual MLP block mlp1 . At this point, for Mand S, we add a 128D A/B embedding to the residualstream. The output is then fed to another residual MLP block mlp2 . At this point, for S, we add a 128D rank embeddingto the residual stream. After this, we feed the activation to the last MLP block. The output of the last MLP block is then fedto a linear head, whose output size is as follows:
•L:2×r×dgiving both AandBmatrices •M:r×dgiving a low-rank matrix AorBdepending on the A/B embedding •S:dgiving a rank of a low-rank matrix depending on both the A/B embedding and the rank embedding.
For ease of explanation, we assume dis the same for the input and the output space of a linear transformation. In practice, din=dout= 4096 forqproj module and din= 4096 , dout= 1024 forvproj module. r= 8 for all adapters in thiswork. Finally, we list the number of trainable parameters of each architecture: 55,252,992forL,34,282,240forM, 4,923,392forS,3,407,872for LoRA.
G.T2L Intialization We use Bias-HyperInit (Beck et al., 2023) to initialize LT2L. Bias-HyperInit initializes the linear output head of thehypernetwork such that the weights are all zeros and the bias matches the initialization of the underlying layers. In our work, this corresponds to the output bias of the Lhypernetwork being initialized to U(−1d,1d)for the Ahead and all zero for the Bhead to match the initialization of traditional LoRA. For other architectures, we aim to match the gradient magnitude to Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption { "alpha_pattern" : {}, "auto_mapping" :null, "base_model_name_or_path" : "models/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "bias": "none", "fan_in_fan_out" :false, "inference_mode" :true, "init_lora_weights" :true, "layer_replication" :null, "layers_pattern" :null, "layers_to_transform" :null, "loftq_config" : {}, "lora_alpha" : 16, "lora_dropout" : 0.05, "megatron_config" :null, "megatron_core" : "megatron.core", "modules_to_save" :null, "peft_type" : "LORA", "r": 8, "rank_pattern" : {}, "revision" :null, "target_modules" : [ "q_proj", "v_proj" ], "task_type" : "CAUSAL_LM", "use_dora" :false, "use_rslora" :true } Listing 1: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) config for all LoRA adapters.
Lat the beginning of training. That is, for Marchitecture, we initialize the bias of the output head to U(−1√ 2d,1√ 2d).
Finally, Soutput bias is initialized to U(−1√ r2d,1√ r2d). Without this explicit hypernetwork initialization, the training isunstable, and often leads to failed training runs.
H. Training Details All models trained in this work fit in a single H100 GPU (80GB of VRAM). Notably, SFT requires much more memorybecause of the need to backpropagate the gradient through the base LLM. Reconstruction training, on the other hand, shouldbe possible in a modern consumer-grade GPU.
For reconstruction training, we fix the training epochs to be 100K but scale the batch size to match the number of target LoRA adapters. This means the model trains much faster for a lower number of target LoRAs while maintaining the samenumber of optimizer steps. For reference, training to reconstruct 9 benchmark-specific LoRAs takes around 10 minutes tocomplete, while training to reconstruct 479 SNI LoRA adapters takes around 10 hours.
For SFT training with fixed compute budget, we aim to keep the number of optimizer steps the same as we do forreconstruction training. However, since we cannot fit all fine-tuning samples, we scale the number of epochs inverse to thenumber of training tasks.
Additionally, for reconstruction training, instead of predicting the weights directly, T2L learns to predict the z-score of anormal distribution of each weight entry in the low-rank A,Bmatrices. At test time, the output is multiplied by the standard Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaptiondeviation of each element before adding to the mean, converting the prediction to the correct scale.
I. Ad-hoc FLOPs Analysis LetSbe the sequence length, Hbe the hidden size, and Lbe the number of layers of a Transformer-based LLM. We use thefollowing equations for computing the matrix multiplications (GEMMs) FLOPs (Korthikanti et al., 2023).
FLOPs for Self-Attention (per layer): 8×S×H2+ 4×H×S2 FLOPs for FFN (per layer): 16×S×H2 Per Transformer Block Total FLOPs: 24×S×H2+ 4×H×S2 Setup for comparison:
• 3-shot ICL examples are approximately 256 tokens long • Question instances are approximately 64 tokens long • Task descriptions are approximately 48 tokens long • We consider one question instance as the main input to the base model • We only consider input tokens for the FLOPs calculation •We use ‘Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2‘ as the base model (S = 256 + 64 (3-shot ICL + question instance), H = 4096, L = 32) •When the based model is used with T2L, we do not include 3-shot ICL (S = 64 (question instance), H = 4096, L = 32) • We use ‘gte-large-en-v1.5‘ as the task description encoder (S = 48 (task description), H = 1024, L = 24) • We use the M hypernetwork architecture detailed in the Appendix F I.1. T2L per instance FLOPsgte-large-en-v1.5: FLOPs = 24×(24×48×10242+ 4×1024×482) = 0 .029TFLOPs/instance Hypernetwork (M): FLOPs = 2×1024×64 + 4 ×4×128×512 + 128 ×4096×8 = 0 .000005 TFLOPs/instance Base LLM w/o ICL: FLOPs = 32×(24×64×40962+ 4×4096×642) = 0 .827TFLOPs/instance Total FLOPs = 0.029 + 0 .000005 + 0 .827 = 0.856005 TFLOPs/instance I.2. Base LLM with 3-shot ICL Total FLOPs =32×(24×(256 + 64) ×40962+ 4×(4096) ×(256 + 64)2) =4.177 TFLOPs/instance Based on this calculation, we can see that the adaptation cost of T2L is significantly cheaper than 3-shot ICL—more than 4x FLOPs reduction, saving compute within the first question instance.
J. Training and Evaluation Datasets We use 500 SNI datasets publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Lots-of-LoRAs . 479 tasks are usedfor training and the rest for evaluation. Specifically, we use the following evaluation tasks: task 035, task 039, task 1557, task 202, task 304, task 362, task 614, task 701, task 706, task 710, task 726. For the in-context learning baseline, weuse 3-shot in-context examples taken from the training split of each benchmark except MBPP that has an explicit split forin-context prompting. HumanEval only has the test split, therefore it is always evaluated against in the zero-shot manner.

J.1. Benchmark Details Every benchmark used in the experiments is publicly available in HuggingFace dataset space. We evaluate the models onthe benchmarks detailed as follows.
J.1.1. GSM8K We evaluate the models on the test split, using chain-of-thought response pre-filling: ”Let’s think step by step. ” J.1.2. H UMAN EVAL AND MBPP We use the evalplus library (Liu et al., 2023) for coding evaluation. For both MBPP and HumanEval, we use thefollowing response pre-fill: ‘‘‘python Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaption J.2. Question-Answering Tasks The rest of the benchmarks are question-answering based tasks. In these tasks, we do not use response-prefilling. Instead, each task has a specific instruction template shown in Listing 4.

There is a positive correlation between the two variables indicated by small positive Pearson correlationcoefficients.
Similar to Figure 6, Figure 11 shows the similarity of SNI adapters to benchmark-specific adapters, but instead of using theconcatenation of flattened AandBmatrices, we use flattened ∆Winstead. With the change, we find a positive correlationbetween the task embedding similarity and the adapter similarity in the weight space. This is likely because, for a given ∆Wmatrix, there are many possible permutations of low-rank matrices AandB. This suggests that if we compute thereconstruction loss in the full adaptation matrix space, reconstruction-trained T2L could generalize better. However, weempirically find that it does not outperform T2L trained to reconstruct low-rank matrices at zero-shot LoRA generation.
L. Generating Task Descriptions with a Foundation Language Model We automate task description generation for each task by leveraging powerful closed-source language models (Achiam et al., 2023). We query GPT-4o mini with carefully constructed prompts that incentivize diversity to facilitate downstreamgeneralization. In particular, we generate 200 descriptions per task by querying the model 10 times, each time asking for 20descriptions given randomly sampled five question-answer pairs from the task. We leverage in-context learning by providingexamples of question-answer pairs with matching descriptions. Finally, we also designed our prompts to avoid overlyverbose responses and unnecessary information, such as explicit mentions of answer formats and additional instructions. Weuse the generated descriptions for the training and benchmark tasks. Figure 12 shows the exact prompt used for querying GPT-4o mini for task descriptions.
