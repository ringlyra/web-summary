## 要約

本論文では、大規模言語モデルを対象に**強化学習**を導入した新手法**RPT**を提案。従来の**次トークン予測**を理由づけ可能な推論課題と捉え、正解トークンに報酬を与える形で学習し、汎用的な強化学習能力を獲得する。計算資源を増やすほど予測精度が向上し、特定領域の教師データなしで大規模テキストから有用な表現が得られる。RPTによる事前学習はその後の強化学習による微調整の効果を高め、拡張性の高いモデル構築を可能にする。実験では計算量増加に伴う精度向上と下流タスクへの好影響を確認し、**LLM**の新たなスケーリングパラダイムとして期待され、スケーリング曲線は計算増に伴い精度が向上することを示す。

| **Case 1** |
| Okay, I need to figure out what the next token is in the given text under the Context section. The user provided a partially completed text about integers, comparing and ordering them … First, I’ll analyze the context provided …  Wait, the user wrote 6 x 4 = 24, 20 > 18 x, so the next token is probably the second fraction …  One way to find a common denominator is to multiply the two original denominators …  Alternatively, it could be …  Wait, but 18 x 24? That doesn’t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it’s 18 x 4 = 72 or something…  Another approach: perhaps the next token is …  Let me see: if the two fractions are 5/3 and 4/6. 5/3 is greater than 4/6 because 5/3 is 1.666…, and 4/6 is 0.666…, to compare them, find a common denominator…  Alternatively, perhaps the next token is a backslash or something in LaTeX. Wait, but in the Markdown, the user presented it as: Writing Equivalent Fractions …  But wait, in the user’s provided context, it’s …  Maybe the next token is another multiplication symbol, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it’s just the end of the thought. But given the context, I think that the next token is either a space followed by a ’2’ or a period or something else …  Wait, maybe another example. If the fractions were 5/6 and 4/3 …  So, after ’x’ there’s a space, then ’4’.\n</think>\n\nSo, the next token is ’ 4’.\n\n\boxed{ 4} |
| **Case 2** |
| Okay, I need to figure out what the next token is in the given text under the Context section. Using the integral test, for a set …  Maybe the original answer was just a partial sentence. Let’s think again. The question is to prove convergence of the series, the answer uses the integral test, which is the standard approach …  Alternatively, maybe the original answer was longer, but got cut off, so I need to predict what comes next. Maybe the next token is …  So the next token is a space and then something. Alternatively, perhaps it’s a continuation of the same sentence …  Therefore, by the integral test, the series converges when $p > 1$. No, perhaps it’s better to see what the original answer was supposed to be. The correct full proof would be: Using the integral test, for a set …  But the user instruction is to provide the next token after the given text …  Alternatively, looking at the way the answer was written, perhaps …  I think the next token is ’$’.\n</think>\n\nSo, the next token is ’$’.\n\n\boxed{$} |
| **Case 3** |
| Okay, I need to figure out what the next token is in the given text under the Context section. The text so far is: Call the large circle’s center …  Scaling by a factor… Perhaps the next part is the ratio of the radii? Or maybe something else. Wait, the scaling factor is probably such that the smaller circle is scaled up to match the larger circle or something …  So, in coordinates, perhaps O1 is at (0,0), O2 is at (41,0). The small circle has radius 13, so the points where O1O2 intersects the small circle are at O2 plus or minus 13 units towards O1 …  So, point A is on the small circle, further away from O1 than O2, right. Because if you go from O2 towards O1, 13 units, that would be …  So, the next token after ’Scale the small circle by a factor of’ would probably be the number 30/13 …  Wait, I’m a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it’s presented as a fraction …  Scale the small circle by a factor of. So, the actual next token is the next word or symbol …  Wait, but in the context given, the user just wrote …  Alternatively, perhaps in the text it’s written as …  So, in the given text, the next token after ’Scale the small circle by a factor of’ is space.\n</think>\n\nThe next token is ’ ’.\n\n\boxed{ } |
